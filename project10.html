<b>Introduction</b><br/>

Joint word segmentation and POS-tagging is the problem of solving word
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging simultaneously. By reducing
error propagation and allowing POS information to help word
segmentation, both segmentation and overall tagging could be improved.
There has been some recent research on joint word segmentation and POS
tagging, reporting competitive accuracies on the Chinese Treebank. </p><p>

The current approach for joint segmentation and POS-tagging is mainly
supervised. A set of manually annotated sentences from CTB are used to
train a system, and then another set of texts from the same treebank
are used to test the accuracies. Supervised learning is expensive: it
requires much human labour. On the other hand, there are abundant
unannotated text available. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
approaches make use of these free resources, and improve the
accuracies. They have been little explored for joint segmentation and
POS-tagging so far.</p><p>

Two existing approaches can be applied to joint segmentation and
POS-tagging, and achieve semi-supervised learning. First, unsupervised
character clustering can be performed on a large set of raw text. The
resulting character classes can be used as a feature in a supervised
segmentor / tagger. Results have shown that this method improves both
the segmentation accuracy.</p><p>

Second, self-training can be performed. The idea is to use a trained
system to segment and tag raw text. From the output, some statistical
information can be collected. When processed properly, this
information can be filtered / organized into features. Self-training
has been show to improve accuracies for a variety of NLP tasks.

<p><b>Requirements</b><br/>

Basic knowledge of C++. (A supervised system in cpp will be provided)</p>

<p><b>An intuitive example</b><br/>

Given the input sentence 上海浦东开发与法制建设同步, the existing system will produce the tagged output 上海_NR 浦东_NR 开发_NN 与_CC 法制_NN 建设_NN 同步_VV. The output is a segmented and part-of-speech tagged sentence, where each word is separated from its POS by '_' and NR, NN, CC and VV refer to proper noun, noun, conjunctive and verb, respectively. The above output is correct. However, given the sentence 玩3D游戏有必要搞独立显卡么？, the output of the sytem is 玩3D_NR 游戏_NN 有_VE 必要_NN 搞_VV 独立_JJ 显卡么_NN ？_PU, where 玩3D and 显卡么 has segmentation and POS errors. The reason for the errors are largely because the training data was in newspaper text, while the test data was from computer forums. The semi-supervised system should improve the performance of the system in such unknown domains. </p>
