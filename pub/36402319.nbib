AB  - Adsorption of organic molecules from aqueous solution offers a simple and 
      effective method for their removal. Recently, there have been several attempts to 
      apply machine learning (ML) for this problem. To this end, polyparameter linear 
      free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) were employed, and poor prediction results 
      were observed outside model applicability domain of pp-LFERs. In this study, we 
      improved the applicability of ML methods by adopting a chemical-structure (CS) 
      based approach. We used the prediction of adsorption of organic molecules on 
      carbon-based adsorbents as an example. Our results show that this approach can 
      fully differentiate the structural differences between any organic molecules, 
      while providing significant information that is relevant to their interaction 
      with the adsorbents. We compared two CS feature descriptors: 3D-coordination and 
      simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). We then built CS-ML models 
      based on neural networks (NN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). They all 
      outperformed pp-LFERs based models and are capable to accurately predict 
      adsorption isotherm of isomers with similar physiochemical properties such as 
      chiral molecules, even though they are trained with achiral molecules and 
      racemates. We found for predicting adsorption isotherm, XGB shows better 
      performance than NN, and 3D-coordinations allow effective differentiation between 
      organic molecules.
