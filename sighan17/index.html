        <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
        <p>The 9th SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN-9) at IJCNLP 2017, December 01, 2017, Taiwan </p>
        <p>Growing interest in Chinese language processing is leading to the development of linguistic corpora and automatic tools. As more resources have become available recently, it is crucial to create a platform that allows easy exchange of information and data and the comparison of different approaches to various NLP tasks. Among about 20 SIGs within the Association for Computational Linguistics, SIGHAN (Special Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing) provides an umbrella for researchers in industry and academia working in various aspects of Chinese language processing. SIGHAN workshop provides an international forum for both researchers and practitioners to report their latest innovations, summarize state-of-the-art in the field, as well as exchange ideas, results, and visions in all aspects of Chinese language processing.</p>

        <p>The previous SIGHAN workshop series were started in 2002. SIGHAN-1 was held in conjunction with COLING-02 (Taipei, Taiwan); SIGHAN-2 was held in conjunction with ACL-03 (Sapporo, Japan); SIGHAN-3 was held in conjunction with ACL-04 (Barcelona, Spain); SIGHAN-4 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-05 (Jeju Island, Korea); SIGHAN-5 was held in conjunction with ACL-COLING-06 (Sydney, Australia); SIGHAN-6 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-08 (Hyderabad, India); SIGHAN-7 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-13 (Nagoya, Japan) and SIGHAN-8 was held in conjunction with ACL-IJCNLP 2015 (Beijing, China). </p>

        <p>The purpose of the SIGHAN-9 is to identify challenging problems facing the development of Chinese language processing systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. We encourage submissions of papers on all topics in the general areas related to computational linguistics and speech/text processing of Chinese natural languages.
