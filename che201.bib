abstract="Lexical analysis and parsing tasks model the deeper properties of the words and their relationships to each other. The commonly used techniques involve word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and parsing. A typical characteristic of such tasks is that the outputs are structured. Two types of methods are usually used to solve these structured prediction tasks: graph-based methods and transition-based methods. Graph-based methods differentiate output structures based on their characteristics directly, while transition-based methods transform output construction processes into state transition processes, differentiating sequences of transition actions. Neural network models have been successfully used for both graph-based and transition-based structured prediction. In this chapter, we give a review of applying deep learning in lexical analysis and parsing, and compare with traditional statistical methods.",
